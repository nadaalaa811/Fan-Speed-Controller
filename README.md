# Fan-Speed-Controller

Using Atmega32 microcontroller the fan is automatically turned ON or OFF according to the temperature.:
<ul>
        <li> If the temperature is less than 30C turn off the fan.</li>
        <li> If the temperature is greater than or equal 30C turn on the fan with 25% of its
            maximum speed.</li>
        <li> If the temperature is greater than or equal 60C turn on the fan with 50% of its
            maximum speed.</li>
        <li> If the temperature is greater than or equal 90C turn on the fan with 75% of its
            maximum speed.</li>
        <li> If the temperature is greater than or equal 120C turn on the fan with 100% of its
            maximum speed.</li>
    </ul>
